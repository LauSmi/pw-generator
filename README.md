# Password Generator Refactor Assignment

# Description: 
This is a refactor exercise where I completed a password generator using source code provided by the University of Minnisota Bootcamp program. I added HTML, CSS and JavaScript code to make the password generator functional.  I finished this challenge with the help of a step-by-step tutorial by Tyler Potts on YouTube, while fitting the code to the parameters already supplied.

# Installation N/A

# Usage: 
The password generator will create a password from 8-128 characters. The user can customize their password by checking and unchecking the boxes including uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols. If no boxes are checked, a password will not generate.
